# User Management Service FRS

This document describes the functional requirements for a User Management Service that provides core authentication and user profile management capabilities.

## Overview

The User Management Service is a RESTful API service that handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and authorization. It serves as the central authentication and user data service for our platform.

## Business Context

### Goals
- Provide secure user authentication
- Enable self-service user registration
- Support profile management
- Implement role-based access control
- Ensure GDPR compliance for user data

### Success Metrics
- 99.9% service availability
- < 200ms authentication response time
- Support for 10,000 concurrent users
- Zero security breaches

## Functional Requirements

### User Registration
- Users can register with email and password
- Email verification is required
- Password must meet complexity requirements
- Support for OAuth 2.0 social login (Google, GitHub)
- Duplicate email prevention

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Refresh token support
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) optional
- Session management
- Password reset functionality

### User Profile Management
- Users can view their profile
- Users can update profile information
- Profile picture upload support
- Email change with verification
- Account deletion (GDPR compliance)

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Default roles: Admin, User, Guest
- Permission management
- API key generation for service accounts

## Technical Requirements

### API Endpoints
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/logout
- POST /auth/refresh
- GET /users/profile
- PUT /users/profile
- DELETE /users/account
- POST /auth/password-reset
- GET /admin/users (admin only)

### Data Model
- User entity with UUID primary key
- Profile data as JSONB
- Audit trail for all changes
- Soft delete for GDPR compliance

### Security Requirements
- bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT with RS256 signing
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- 1000 requests per second capacity
- P95 latency < 500ms
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching for sessions

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Stateless service design
- Database read replicas
- Load balancer ready

### Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics
- Structured logging (JSON)
- Distributed tracing
- Health check endpoints

## Integration Points

### External Services
- Email service for notifications
- SMS gateway for MFA
- OAuth providers
- Analytics service

### Internal Services
- Notification service
- Audit service
- Analytics pipeline

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use PostgreSQL database
- Must deploy on Kubernetes
- Must support multi-tenancy
- Budget limited to $5000/month

### Assumptions
- Users have valid email addresses
- Network connectivity is reliable
- PostgreSQL is already provisioned
- Kubernetes cluster is available

## Risks and Mitigations

### Identified Risks
1. **Risk**: Credential stuffing attacks
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, account lockout

2. **Risk**: Data breach
   - **Mitigation**: Encryption at rest, regular security audits

3. **Risk**: Service downtime
   - **Mitigation**: High availability setup, automated failover

4. **Risk**: GDPR non-compliance
   - **Mitigation**: Data retention policies, audit logging

## Acceptance Criteria

- All endpoints return correct status codes
- Authentication works with valid credentials
- Invalid credentials are rejected
- Profile updates persist correctly
- Admin endpoints require admin role
- Performance meets SLA requirements
- Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation is complete and accurate
